On death, the worm can drop
a variety of items.

Most of the time, rotten
flesh from the worm's
previous haf-digested meals
can be discovered. But much
more importantly is the
chitin from the worm's exterior.







This can be crafted into armor
that has extra toughness, compared
to similar sets.






Even more prized than the chitin
that the worm creates is the rare
drop of an egg.






Similar to a chicken egg, the
death worm egg will produce a
pathetic-sized worm when tossed.
But this worm isn't wild, rather
it seeks to protect both its
owner and its hunting grounds.
