Long ago, before the trolls dwelled
in the caves and before the gorgons
entered their temples, there was a
woman who stole from the gods a
plough, and claimed it for her own
invention. For this crime, she was
metamorphosed into an terrifying
insect: the first Myrmex Queen.

Although she was the first of her
kind, she was not alone for long
as her insectoid fecundity resulted
in massive Myrmex colonies all
across the deserts and jungles.

The myrmex visage is a hideous one,
a large insect with a powerful stinger
and mandibles. Their society is
separated into castes like eusocial
insects.




§nWorkers
Workers are the smallest of all
caste members. They are the
laborers of the colony, and leave
it frequently to gather food and
other resources. These items are
deposited in the Food Rooms of
the colony. Workers are also
responsible for moving young
myrmex eggs, larva and pupae to
the Nursery Rooms. They are the
most frequently encountered
Myrmex Caste outside the colony
and as such are frequently preyed
upon by death worms. They are
usually escorted by Soldiers.
