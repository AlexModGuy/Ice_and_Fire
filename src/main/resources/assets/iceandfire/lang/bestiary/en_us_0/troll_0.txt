Trolls are terrifying beasts that
live deep underground in caverns.
These powerful monsters can be
encountered in the caves of
forests, hills, and icy biomes of
the world.











These hulking creatures each
weild a massive weapon that

they use to crush their
potential prey.











Whether by a strike from the side
or an over-the-head slam, the troll
bashes its target with whatever
club-like object it can find,
including: stone pillars, tree
logs, and rudimentary axes.
