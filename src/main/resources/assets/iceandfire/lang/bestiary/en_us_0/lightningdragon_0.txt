    For all too long we have heard
Tales of giant reptiles, both of
which are incarnations of a primal
element; fire and ice. But word has
spread of a similar creature which
lingers in only the most exotic
biomes - the lightning dragon.

Haunting the black night skies of
savannas, mesas and jungles, the
lightning dragon is nocturnal,
unlike its fire and ice cousins.
The lightning dragon inhabits
roosts and underground caves full
of crackled blocks that have been
struck by lightning. Like how ice
and fire dragons have affinities for
certain metals and gemstones,
lightning dragons love copper and
amethyst.

copper ore can be found in high
elevation anywhere in the
overworld. Amethyst only occurs
deep underground in savannas.

Copper can be made into any form
that silver can, although it is
a much weaker metal.
