    After taking down one of the
more monstrous fire dragons I
had found in a cavern, I noticed
that the beast was guarding its
own clutch of eggs. These eggs
were a multitude of beautiful
colors, all coated in shiny scales.

I instantly thought of how much
worth these eggs could be sold
for, probably even more than
many diamonds. However, eggs
have one purpose to the dragon
themselves: to propagate their
own species. Remembering something

I had read in some old manuscripts,
that dragons have strong maternal
instincts and care for their
young, I set out to find out how
to raise my own brood of dragons.

While moving the eggs to a safer
location near my home, I noticed
that these eggs were much warmer
than those of a chicken or other
bird. This gave me an idea on
how to unlock the secrets of the
dragons...

I stacked up some wood and
netherrack into a large pile and
placed the largest of the eggs
onto it.
