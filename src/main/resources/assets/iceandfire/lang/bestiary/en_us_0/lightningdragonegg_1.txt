Once the egg was under the sky,
I waited several days until
rain came, apon which the egg
began to actively shake and move.
When the rains passed, the egg
stopped, but I remembered that
dragons require a great deal of
time to become such large and
powerful creatures, so I let
the egg stay in its place.

Deciding not to be hasty, I let
the egg sit under the rainy sky
for three days.

My decision was very successful!
The dragon's egg hatched and I
am now in possession of a young
dragon. I'll have to write
another entry some other time
to describe my experiences with
this new friend.
