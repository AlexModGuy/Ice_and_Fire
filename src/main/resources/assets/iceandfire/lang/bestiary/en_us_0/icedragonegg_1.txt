Once the egg was inside the pond,
I filled the pond  around the
egg in order to cool it down.
After waiting for around a short
time, I could not see any
difference with the egg. I
thought of removing the egg and
looking for another method of

hatching the egg, but I
remembered that dragons are
large beings that require a
great amount of time to grow.
Deciding not to be hasty,
I let the egg sit in the lake
for three days.

My decision was very successful!
The egg formed ice around itself
and in a few days hatched! I
am now in possession of a young
dragon. I'll have to write
another entry some other time
to describe my experiences with
this new friend.
