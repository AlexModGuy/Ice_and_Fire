Explorers who venture into the deep
jungles have often told tales of
the great beasts that glide through
the canopies above. These creatures
could not be anything but
amphitheres.







Amphitheres are legendary beasts
rooted in mythology. Said to be
the protectors of jungles,
Amphitheres are usually peaceful,
but will attack anything that
hurts villagers or others living
in their home land.
Amphitheres come in many different
beautiful feather colorations.













Soaring through the tree line
above, Amphitheres utilize the
wind and never seem to need to
rest. However, this reliance on
the wind to fly makes them
vulnerable to arrow attacks.
