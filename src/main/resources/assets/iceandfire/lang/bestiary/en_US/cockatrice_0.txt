The half-lizard, half-fowl
appearance of the cockatrice might
not be as terrifying as that of a
troll or deathworm, but that does
not make it less deadly.

This beast can prove to be a
formidible enemy to those who
encounter it whilst wandering
the savannas of the world.
Although the cockatrice can
strike prey with its sharpened
beak, or slice with its talons,
the beast possesses a far
stronger weapon: its vision.

If one's eyes lock those of the
cockatrice, their soul will
start to wither away. The













cockatrice can kill prey very
quickly simply by gazing at it.

In order to protect from this
attack, potential slayers of
cockatrices may want to craft
protection in the form of a
Blindfold.
