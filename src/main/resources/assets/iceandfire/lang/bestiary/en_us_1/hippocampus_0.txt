An elusive, fast and beautiful
creature can be rarely found in
Oceans. The Hippocampus appears
to be a strange mixture of
animals with both equine and
piscine traits. Exceptionally
fast when submerged, no known
creature can keep up with
the hippocampus underwater.
However, it's abilities on
dry land are extremely
weakened.

The hippocampus is a very
passive creature and will
never attack any other being,
even to save its own life.
















Hippocampi are colorful
and diverse creatures,
and appear in many colors.

It can be noticed that
hippcampi have an affinity
to sponges and to prismarine
crystals.
