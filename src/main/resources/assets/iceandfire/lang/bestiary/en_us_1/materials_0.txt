    After you have slayed a
dragon or come across one's corpse,
one can loot from it by interacting
wit it.






Dragon scales are one of the most
common items that can be recovered
from dead beasts. They can be crafted
into suits of armor, which are very
durable.





The second most common loot one can
receive are dragon bones.







Dragon bones are used in many
recipes, but are mostly for crafting
tools and weapons. These recipes
usually involve the use of wither
bone instead of sticks. Wither bone
can be gathered form black
skeletons in the nether.
