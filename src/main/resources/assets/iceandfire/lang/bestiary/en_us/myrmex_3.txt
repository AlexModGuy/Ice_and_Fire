All Myrmex Chitin weapons are
weak against arthropods, but
do extra damage to non-arthropods
and death worms.




Myrmex Stingers are used to create
poisonous swords that are more
poweful than normal myrmex weapons.



Myrmex Resin Chunks are dropped by
myrmex of all castes. Myrmex
produce this strange material
by themselves, yet they still
will seek out any of it, if

they can find it. By throwing
resin chunks on the ground near
Myrmex Workers, one can raise
their reputation with the hive.

Reputation is an important
concept to consider when dealing
with Myrmex colonies. Reputation
can be raised by gifting and
trading, and can be lowered by
attacking or killing any colony
members.

The default reputation towards
humans for every colony is 0.
At 25, Myrmex will become neutral.
At 50, they will open up to trade.
At 75, they will allow one to use
myrmex staffs on the colony as a
whole.
